An agent is constructed with the following parameters:

- `name`: The identifier of the agent.
- `model`: The language model instance from the LLM SDK.
- `instructions`: A list of instructions to be injected into the system prompt to guide the agent's behavior.
- `tools`: A list of _executable_ tools that the agent can call during its execution.
- `response_format`: The expected response format from the agent. While the default is plain text, it can be customized to return structured output.
- `max_turns`: The maximum number of turns the agent can take to complete a request.
- Other sampling parameters: `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, etc.
- Model output options such as `modalities`, `thinking`, and `audio`.

In addition, the agent is defined with a `context` generic type that can be accessed in the instructions (for dynamic instructions) and tools.
