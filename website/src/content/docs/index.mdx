`llm-sdk` is a suite of library to interact with various Large Language Model (LLM) providers through a unified API and build agentic AI applications.

Two libraries are provided:

- [LLM SDK](./sdk): Unified SDKs to interact with various LLM providers.
- [LLM Agent](./agent): An abstraction to build agentic AI applications using the LLM SDK.

Check out the [Console Application](/console/chat) for a demo application that showcases the capabilities of the libraries.
